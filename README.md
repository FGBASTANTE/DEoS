##PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR EXPLOSIVE DETONATION PARAMETERS\n
In this script is implemented the DEoS model, a predictive model of explosive
detonation velocity and pressure based on first order
approximation of the detonation velocity equation. Please see:

Data Inputs (example):
-    name = "PBX9502" # the name of explosive without blanks
-    rho = 1.90  # density in g/cc (must be >1g//cc)
-    C = 2.30    # number of moles
-    H = 2.23    # number of moles
-    N = 2.21    # number of moles
-    O = 2.21    # number of moles 
-    W = 3.81    # weight percent of other elements (Cl/F/P/Si % must be <10)
-    HR = -205.5 # enthalpy standard of formation in cal/g (1 atm, 298 K)
-    filename = "PBX9502_1.90" # filename for saving results

The script can read datainputs from cli...:
 -   python deos.py name rho C H N O W HR outputfilename 
example:
 -   python deos.py PBX9502 1.90 2.30 2.23 2.21 2.21 3.81 -205.5 out_pbx9052 
the units are:
-        ........  string, g/cc, mol, mol, mol, mol, %weight, cal/g, string
